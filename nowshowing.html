<h2> John Wick</h2>
<p> Come and play. Everything's A-OK. Friendly neighbors there that's where we meet. Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street? Maybe you and me were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati. Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny the last Battlestar – Galactica - leads a rag-tag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest - a shining planet known as Earth. No phone no lights no motor car not a single luxury. Like Robinson Crusoe it's primitive as can be. The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle with Gilligan the Skipper too the millionaire and his wife. They were four men living all together yet they were all alone.<P>
